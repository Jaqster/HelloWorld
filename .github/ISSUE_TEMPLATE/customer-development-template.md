Please include the relevant information for each stage of the process.

**1.  Problem Scoping**
- What is the exact problem? 
- Is it symptomatic of some underlying issue?
- How do we know for sure it's a problem?
- Is this a problem for some but not others?
- How BIG is the problem?  # of people / impact of problem (rats vs. dents)

*Insert relevant information here...*

At the end of this stage, determine if this is a Problem/Opportunity we want to solve now, later or never.

**2.  Brainstorming Solutions**
What are some different options for a solution? 
- Provide 2 or more options
- Think blue-sky, and think on-the-ground 
- Get as visual as possible, but no polish (whiteboard sketches)
- Yes AND

*Insert relevant information here or link to OneNote page or Figma...*

**3.  Picking Ideas**
Pick a couple ideas to move forward:
- What’s the minimum viable solution?
- What’s the best possible solution?
- How well do we think it solves the problem?
- How much work is it to implement?
- Is there a good/better/best or phased approach?
- How does it impact other parts of the product or user experience?
- Does this solution bring along any other benefits?
- Pros / Cons list can help narrow down ideas

*Insert relevant information here...*

**4.  Design Mock-ups**
- Design wireframes or mock-ups for the selected ideas to test
- Designs may be passed off to engineering to implement, or directly used for Testing
- For big feature areas, may think about phased design approaches - North Star design vs. MVP design

*Insert relevant information here or link to Figma or Design files...*

**5.  Testing**
- How will we know these solutions work? 
- What evidence do we already have? 
- What experiments do we need to run to collect this evidence?
- Telemetry, telemetry, telemetry
